# Applying copier-python template updates

**copier-python is managed by its own template!**
When the template changes, copier-python itself can be updated with:

```sh
copier update
```

This will repeat the setup prompts, in case any prompts have been added or
changed.

To apply updates without being prompted (reusing all previous answers), run:

```sh
copier update -l
```

When [`copier update`][copier-update] is finished, view changes with
`git status` and `git diff`. Resolve any conflicts, and then commit the result.
