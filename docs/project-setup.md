This template uses [trusted publishing][pypi-trusted-publishing] so no API
tokens need to be stored as secrets.

1. On PyPI, add a (pending) trusted publisher in your
   [Trusted Publisher Management][pypi-publishing-settings] settings:
     - Publisher: GitHub Actions
     - Owner: `<your-github-user>`
     - Repository: `<your-project-name>`
     - Workflow: `release.yaml`
     - Environment: `pypi`

   ```sh
   git tag v0.1.0  # or your desired first version number
   git push --tags
   ```
